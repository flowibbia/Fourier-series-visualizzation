	<h1>Play with Sines</h1>

	<p>This project was inspired by the following article 
		<a href="https://bilimneguzellan.net/en/purrier-series-meow-and-making-images-speak/">Purrier Series</a><br>
		The purpose of this project is just to play with sines, from the article linking above, 
		you can see that you can approximate periodic function with sums of sines.

		A trivial sines is composed from an amplitude and a frequency, below you can see graphically how multiple sines
		are added togheter, and if you put right fourier coefficient for a function, you can approximate it.

		From the button rectangle wave and triangle wave, you get 15 coefficient for the relative function.<br>

	</p>

	<h2>How to play</h2>
	<p>
		The amplitude is expressed in pixel, if the coefficient is too small, scale all coefficient multiplying for the same 
		factor.<br>
		The n box is for the n-th coefficient and is a multiple of the fundamental frequency, don't worry for the value of this, 
		it is irrelevant for the shape of the function.
